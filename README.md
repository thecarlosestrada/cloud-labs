# Lab 00: Linux Basics

##Objetive
Practice the most basic Linux commands for navigation and file management.

##Environment
- Ubuntu VM (UTM on Mac)
- Terminal only

##Commands Practiced
- whoami
- pwd
-ls, ls -la
- mkdir, cd, rmdir
- touch, echo, cat
- cp, mv, rm, rm -r

##Evidence
- Logs: logs/session-2025-09-06-2338.log

##Lessons Learned
- `rmdir` only works with empty directories.
- To delete a directory with files, use `rm -r`.
- You cannot delete a directory from inside it (`cd ..` first).
- Practicing small commands helps me feel more comfortable in the terminal.

## Next Steps
- Explore permissions with chmod and chown.
- Check system processes with ps and top.
- Prepare for Lab 01 (Python HTTP Server).
